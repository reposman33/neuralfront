This neural network was built using Tensorflow and Keras.</p><h4>Transfer Learning</h4><p>We use the pretrained Inception v3 network.  The top layers of this network have been retrained for the particular purpose of recognizing fruit.  This is much faster than completely training a deep neural network from scratch.</p><h4>Training</h4><p>We trained this application on a collection of 30.000 images.  We collected this dataset using screen scraping on Google Images</p>",
